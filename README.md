# INDOOR AIR QUALITY MODELING BASED ON IoT
The purpose of this report is to provide an overview of indoor air quality (IAQ) modeling based on Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.

## Objective
The objective of this project a real-time model to monitor and control the indoor air quality.

## Abstract
In this project, an IoT-based system is developed to model indoor air quality (IAQ). The system utilizes IoT sensors to collect real-time data on IAQ parameters such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide levels, and volatile organic compounds. Advanced data analysis techniques are applied to gain insights into IAQ patterns and identify potential issues. The project aims to improve IAQ monitoring and management practices, leading to healthier indoor environments. The system includes IoT sensor deployment, data acquisition, data analysis algorithms, and a user-friendly interface for data visualization. The project outcomes contribute to better understanding IAQ dynamics and enhancing IAQ management practices for improved health and comfort.
